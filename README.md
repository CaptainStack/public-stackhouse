# [Public Stackhouse](https://captainstack.github.io/public-stackhouse/)
Public Stackhouse began as a public repo for my solutions to common coding interview questions. It eventually became my full blown personal website. I am consistently implementing solutions to new questions and adding side projects to the portfolio section. The site is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://captainstack.github.io/public-stackhouse/).

Many are problems from [Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1487198960&sr=8-1&keywords=cracking+the+coding+interview), but I've also included problems my friends have thrown at me for practice, and problems I've been asked to implement in real-world interviews. These solutions are all written in JavaScript (with all the nice ES2015 features!) for now. Please feel free to use the problems and solutions for your own purposes.
